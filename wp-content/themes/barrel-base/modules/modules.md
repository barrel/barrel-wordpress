### Guidelines

- Any new modules for your site should be added here as a folder with .css, .php, and if necessary .js files of the same name in the folder.

- If you add a sass file in your module folder, then make sure to import it in your src/scss/main.css file. You can import it by just importing the folder name (ex: @import modules/folder-name)

### NAMING CONVENTION 
- For folders and files: use all lowercase letters, separate words by dashes.

- Module names should be generic and not specific to a designed feature. (For example: if you are making a press modules that uses a 4-Up, name that module 4-up or four-up instead of press).

### PARTIALS
- Partials should be defined in the modules directory as a module.
